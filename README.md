# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I built this website because it was a homework assignment, but also as an intro to certain concepts integral to web development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

It serves as a hub for me to store and revisit information.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use, simply right-click and used the "inspect" option native to Chrome web-dev tools. 


## Credits

Likely not perfect, but that's okay. 

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).


## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
